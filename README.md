## Cy Young Award project


## This project I did was group based and focused on ensuring that those who excel in performance statistics receive recognition for their talent​ We utilized statistics of all pitchers, each year, and historical figures to discover discrepancies in awardee consistency and worthiness.​

## Reasons for this Project
upholds the integrity of the sport​

sets a precedent for recognizing exceptionality in a manner that is equitable​

aligns with the principles of fairness in the MLB.


## Data we created to build in excel for Orange
The data we used was from the Sean Lahman Baseball Database​

We trimmed our data to start at when the Cy Young award started (1956)​

The data only includes pitchers that pitched a minimum of 20 games a year​

Our final dataset has 6,492 and 31 features​

Target variable is "award"
